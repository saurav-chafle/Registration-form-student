1.Create the HTML form structure: The first step is to create the HTML form structure. Use the HTML form tag to create the form, and use the input tag to create form fields such as text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, and drop-down lists.
2.Add CSS styling to the form: Once the HTML form structure is in place, the next step is to add CSS styling to the form. Use CSS to set the font style, background color, and other visual elements. You can also use CSS to add animations and other interactive elements.
3.Validate the form using JavaScript: The next step is to validate the form using JavaScript. JavaScript is used to perform error handling, data validation, and real-time feedback to the user. 
For example, you can use JavaScript to validate the email address, check if all required fields are filled in, and display error messages if the form is not filled in correctly.
4.Submit the form data: Once the form is validated, the final step is to submit the form data. After submission weâ€™ll be showing a sucess message.
